A project originally designed to manage a simple use case:  
- Tracking teachers who wish to buy coffee  
- Automatically generating QR codes for payments  
- Sending QR codes by email  
- Pricing based on person-days attended at school  

â˜• While the original use case became irrelevant during development (with an unfinished GUI), the project has been repurposed into an **experimental sandbox**.  

I now use it for:  
- Practicing **software architecture**  
- Experimenting with **payment QR generation**  
- Exploring fun, unconventional approaches to simple workflows
